This application was built by me and my colleague Junior Vilarino. When we were discussing what theme we should choose for the second project of our Bootcamp, we decided that it would be more fun to work with something we both love: travelling ‒‒ and that is how Wasthere was born.

Wasthere is a collaborative social blog focused on travel experiences. It is a place where you can create posts and share your views about places you have visited: tourist spots, restaurants, or anywhere you believe the world should (or shouldn't) see. You can also rate this experience and add a description to let everybody know what are your thoughts about it, as well as like and comment on other posts.

## How it works

When entering Wasthere, you will see the homepage, which shows all posts created by all the users. By clicking the “See more” button on each post, it is possible to view details like ratings and descriptions. Below the details, there is a comment box where you can see the comments and create your own, and on the top corner, there are the “Delete” and “Edit” buttons. On the navigation bar, on top of the screen, there is a “Post” button. By clicking it, you’ll be redirected to a page where you can create your own post and let the world know about your experiences.

## Development

During the second module of the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack, we focused on learning React.js and experimenting with its possibilities. Therefore, for the second project, the task was to build a React application implementing a fully functioning CRUD — where users can create something, read (or visualize) it, update (or edit) it and delete it. We used a REST API to simulate a fake back-end, as we were not supposed to implement a real one at this point in the course. For this reason, the site is completely open: there is no authentication, and everybody can post, comment, edit or delete freely.

We also used a few libraries and frameworks to boost the app development: react-router-dom to create different front-end routes and implement pages like Home, Post, and Edit; Axios, to handle the API requests which makes it possible that the information provided by the user when, for instance, creating a post is saved and showed; and Bootstrap for styling a clean and responsive interface.

## Final thoughts

After the end of this project, I could better understand how React works and why it is so popular. If one of the first principles we learn when studying programming is DRY ‒‒ don’t repeat yourself ‒‒, React is the perfect tool to build an entire project, simple or complex, with smaller parts that can be reused and, therefore, save some time and space. It is like coding with Lego.
